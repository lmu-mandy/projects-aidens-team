Abstract
Author Manuscript

Coleoid cephalopods (octopus, squid, and cuttlefish) are active, resourceful predators with a rich
behavioral repertoire1. They have the largest nervous systems among the invertebrates2 and
present other striking morphological innovations including camera-like eyes, prehensile arms, a
highly derived early embryogenesis, and the most sophisticated adaptive coloration system among
all animals1,3. To investigate the molecular bases of cephalopod brain and body innovations we
sequenced the genome and multiple transcriptomes of the California two-spot octopus, Octopus
bimaculoides. We found no evidence for hypothesized whole genome duplications in the octopus
lineage4–6. The core developmental and neuronal gene repertoire of the octopus is broadly similar
to that found across invertebrate bilaterians, except for massive expansions in two gene families
formerly thought to be uniquely enlarged in vertebrates: the protocadherins, which regulate
neuronal development, and the C2H2 superfamily of zinc finger transcription factors. Extensive
mRNA editing generates transcript and protein diversity in genes involved in neural excitability,

as previously described7, as well as in genes participating in a broad range of other cellular
functions. We identified hundreds of cephalopod-specific genes, many of which showed elevated
expression levels in such specialized structures as the skin, the suckers, and the nervous system.
Finally, we found evidence for large-scale genomic rearrangements that are closely associated
with transposable element expansions. Our analysis suggests that substantial expansion of a
handful of gene families, along with extensive remodeling of genome linkage and repetitive
content, played a critical role in the evolution of cephalopod morphological innovations, including
their large and complex nervous systems.

Author Manuscript

Soft-bodied cephalopods such as the octopus (Fig. 1a) show remarkable morphological
departures from the basic molluscan body plan, including dexterous arms lined with
hundreds of suckers that function as specialized tactile and chemosensory organs, and an
elaborate chromatophore system under direct neural control that enables rapid changes in
appearance1,8. The octopus nervous system is vastly modified in size and organization
relative to other molluscs, comprising a circumesophageal brain, paired optic lobes, and
axial nerve cords in each arm2,3. Together these structures contain nearly half a billion
neurons, more than six times the number in a mouse brain2,9. Extant coleoid cephalopods
show extraordinarily sophisticated behaviors including complex problem solving, taskdependent conditional discrimination, observational learning and spectacular displays of
camouflage1,10 (Supplementary Videos 1, 2).

Author Manuscript

To explore the genetic features of these highly specialized animals, we sequenced the
Octopus bimaculoides genome by a whole genome shotgun approach (Supplementary Note
1) and annotated it using extensive transcriptome sequence from 12 tissues (Methods;
Supplementary Note 2). The genome assembly captures more than 97% of expressed protein
coding genes and 83% of the estimated 2.7 Gb genome size (Methods; Supplementary Notes
1–3). The unassembled fraction is dominated by high-copy repetitive sequences
(Supplementary Note 1). Nearly 45% of the assembled genome is composed of repetitive
elements, with two bursts of transposon activity occurring ~25 and ~56 mya (Supplementary
Note 4).

Author Manuscript

We predicted 33,638 protein-coding genes (Methods, Supplementary Note 4) and found
alternate splicing at 2,819 loci, but no locus has an extraordinary number of splice variants
(Supplementary Note 4). A-to-G discrepancies between the assembled genome and
transcriptome sequences provided evidence for extensive mRNA editing by adenosine
deaminases acting on RNA (ADARs). Many candidate edits are enriched in neural tissues7
and are found in a range of gene families, including “housekeeping” genes such as the
tubulins, which suggests that RNA edits are more widespread than previously appreciated
(Extended Data Fig. 1, Supplementary Note 5).
Based primarily on chromosome number, several researchers proposed that whole genome
duplications were important in the evolution of the cephalopod body plan4–6, paralleling the
role ascribed to the independent whole genome duplication events that occurred early in
vertebrate evolution11. While this is an attractive framework for both gene family expansion
and increased regulatory complexity across multiple genes, we found no evidence for it. The
gene family expansions present in octopus are predominantly organized in clusters along the

genome, rather than distributed in doubly conserved synteny as expected for a
paleopolyploid12,13 (Supplementary Note 6.2). While genes that regulate development are
often retained in multiple copies after paleopolyploidy in other lineages, they are not
generally expanded in octopus relative to limpet, oyster, and other invertebrate
bilaterians11,14 (Table 1; Supplementary Notes 7.4, 8).

Author Manuscript

While Hox genes are commonly retained in multiple copies following whole genome
duplication15, we found only a single Hox complement in O. bimaculoides, consistent with
the single set of Hox transcripts identified in the bobtail squid Euprymna scolopes with
PCR16. Remarkably, octopus Hox genes are not organized into clusters as in most other
bilaterian genomes15, but are completely atomized (Extended Data Fig. 2; Supplementary
Note 9). While we cannot rule out whole genome duplication followed by considerable gene
loss, the extent of loss needed to support this claim would far exceed that which has been
observed in other paleopolyploid lineages, and it is more plausible that chromosome number
in coleoids increased by chromosome fragmentation.
Mechanisms other than whole genome duplications can drive genomic novelty, including
expansion of existing gene families, evolution of novel genes, modification of gene
regulatory networks, and reorganization of the genome through transposon activity. Within
the O. bimaculoides genome, we found evidence for all of these mechanisms, including
expansions in several gene families, a suite of octopus- and cephalopod-specific genes, and
extensive genome shuffling.

Author Manuscript

In gene family content, domain architecture, and exon-intron structure, the octopus genome
broadly resembles that of the limpet Lottia gigantea17, the polychaete annelid Capitella
teleta17, and the cephalochordate Branchiostoma floridae14 (Supplementary Note 7,
Extended Data Fig. 3). Relative to these invertebrate bilaterians, we found a fairly standard
set of developmentally important transcription factors and signaling pathway genes,
suggesting that the evolution of the cephalopod body plan did not require extreme
expansions of these “toolkit” genes (Table 1; Supplementary Note 8.2). Statistical analysis
of protein domain distributions across animal genomes did, however, identify several
notable gene family expansions in octopus, including protocadherins, C2H2 zinc-finger
proteins (C2H2-ZNFs), interleukin 17-like genes (IL17-like), G-protein coupled receptors
(GPCRs), chitinases, and sialins (Figs. 2–3; Extended Data Figs 4–6; Supplementary Notes
8 and 10).

Author Manuscript

The octopus genome encodes 168 multi-exonic protocadherin genes, nearly three-quarters of
which are found in tandem clusters on the genome (Fig. 2b), a dramatic expansion relative to
the 17–25 genes found in Lottia, Crassostrea, and Capitella genomes. Protocadherins are
homophilic cell adhesion molecules whose function has been primarily studied in mammals,
in which they are required for neuronal development and survival as well as synaptic
specificity18. Single protocadherin genes are found in the invertebrate deuterostomes
Saccoglossus kowalevskii and Strongylocentrotus purpuratus, indicating that their absence
in Drosophila melanogaster and Caenorhabditis elegans is due to gene loss. Vertebrates
also show a remarkable expansion of the protocadherin repertoire, which is generated by
complex splicing from a clustered locus rather than tandem gene duplication (reviewed

in 19). Thus both octopuses and vertebrates have independently evolved a diverse array of
protocadherin genes.
A search of available transcriptome data from the longfin inshore squid Doryteuthis
(formerly, Loligo) pealeii20 also demonstrated an expanded number of protocadherin genes
(Supplementary Note 8.3). Surprisingly, our phylogenetic analyses suggest that the squid
and octopus protocadherin arrays arose independently. Unlinked octopus protocadherins
appear to have expanded ~135 mya, after octopuses diverged from squid. In contrast,
clustered octopus protocadherins are much more similar in sequence, either due to more
recent duplications or gene conversion as found in clustered protocadherins in zebrafish and
mammals21.

Author Manuscript

The expression of protocadherins in octopus neural tissues (Fig. 2) is consistent with a
central role for these genes in establishing and maintaining cephalopod nervous system
organization. Protocadherin diversity provides a mechanism for regulating the short-range
interactions needed for the assembly of local neural circuits18, which is where the greatest
complexity in the cephalopod nervous system appears2. The importance of local neuropil
interactions, rather than long-range connections, is likely due to the limits placed on axon
density and connectivity by the absence of myelin, since thick axons are then required for
rapid high fidelity signal conduction over long distances. The sequence divergence between
octopus and squid protocadherin expansions may reflect the dramatic differences between
decapodiforms and octopuses in brain organization, which have been most clearly
demonstrated for the vertical lobe, a key structure in cephalopod learning and memory
circuits2,22. Finally, the independent expansions and nervous system enrichment of
protocadherins in coleoid cephalopods and vertebrates offers a striking example of
convergent evolution between these clades at the molecular level.
As with the protocadherins, we found multiple clusters of C2H2-ZNF transcription factor
genes (Fig. 3a; Supplementary Note 8.4). The octopus genome contains nearly 1,800 multiexonic C2H2-containing genes (Table 1), more than the 200–400 C2H2-ZNFs found in
other lophotrochozoans and the 500–700 found in eutherian mammals, in which they form
the second largest gene family23. C2H2-ZNF transcription factors contain multiple C2H2
domains that, in combination, result in highly specific nucleic acid binding. The octopus
C2H2-ZNFs typically contain 10–20 C2H2 domains but some have as many as 60
(Supplementary Note 8.4). The majority of the transcripts are expressed in embryonic and
nervous tissues (Fig. 3b). This pattern of expression is consistent with roles for C2H2-ZNFs
in cell fate determination, early development, and transposon silencing, as demonstrated in
genetic model systems23.

Author Manuscript

The expansion of the O. bimaculoides C2H2-ZNFs coincides with a burst of transposable
element activity at ~25 mya (Fig. 3c). The flanking regions of these genes show a significant
enrichment in a 70–90 bp tandem repeat (31% for C2H2 genes vs. 4% for all genes; Fisher’s
exact test p-value < e−16), which parallels the linkage of C2H2 gene expansions to betasatellite repeats in humans24. We also found an expanded C2H2-ZNF repertoire in
amphioxus (Table 1), showing a similar enrichment in satellite-like repeats. These parallels

suggest a common mode of expansion of a highly dynamic transcription factor family
implicated in lineage-specific innovations.

Author Manuscript

To investigate further the evolution of gene families implicated in nervous system
development and function, we surveyed genes associated with axon guidance (Table 1) and
neurotransmission (Table 2), identifying their homologues in octopus and comparing
numbers across a diverse set of animal genomes (Supplementary Notes 8–10). Several
patterns emerged. The gene complements present in the model organisms D. melanogaster
and C. elegans often showed dramatic departures from those seen in lophotrochozoans and
vertebrates (Table 2; Supplementary Note 10). For example, D. melanogaster encodes one
member of the discs, large (DLG) family, a key component of the postsynaptic scaffold. In
contrast, mammals have four DLGs, which (along with other observations) led to
suggestions that vertebrates possess uniquely complex synaptic machinery25. We find,
however, three DLGs in both octopus and limpet, suggesting that vertebrate-fly gene number
differences are not necessarily diagnostic of exceptional vertebrate synaptic complexity
(Supplementary Note 10.6).

Author Manuscript

Overall, neurotransmission gene family sizes in the octopus were very similar to those seen
in other lophotrochozoans (Table 2, Supplementary Note 10), except for a few dramatically
expanded gene families such as the sialic acid vesicular transporters (sialins)
(Supplementary Note 10.2). We did find variations in the sizes of neurotransmission gene
families between human and lophotrochozoans (Table 2, Supplementary Note 10), but no
evidence for systematic expansion of these gene families in vertebrates relative to octopus or
other lophotrochozoans. While some gene families were larger in mammals or absent in
lophotrochozoans (e.g., ligand gated 5-HT receptors), others were absent in mammals and
present in invertebrates (e.g., anionic glutamate and acetylcholine receptors). The
complement of neurotransmission genes in octopus may be broadly typical for a
lophotrochozoan, but our findings suggest it is also not obviously smaller than what is found
in mammals.

Author Manuscript

Among the octopus complement of ligand-gated ion channels, we identified a set of atypical
nicotinic acetylcholine receptor-like genes, most of which are tandemly arrayed in clusters
(Extended Data Fig. 7). These subunits lack several residues identified as necessary for the
binding of acetylcholine26, so it is unlikely that they function as acetylcholine receptors. The
high levels of expression of these divergent subunits within the suckers raises the interesting
possibility that they act as sensory receptors, as do some divergent glutamate receptors in
other protostomes27. In addition, we identified 74 Aplysia-like and 11 vertebrate-like
candidate chemoreceptors among the octopus GPCR superfamily of ~320 genes (Extended
Data Fig. 6).
We found, amid extensive transcription of octopus transposons, that a class of octopusspecific SINEs is highly expressed in neural tissues (Supplementary Note 4, Extended Data
Fig. 8). While the role of active transposons is unclear, elevated transposon expression in
neural tissues has been suggested to serve an important function in learning and memory in
mammals and flies28.

Transposable element insertions are often associated with genomic rearrangements29 and we
found that the transposon-rich octopus genome displays substantial loss of ancestral
bilaterian linkages that are conserved in other species (Supplementary Note 6; Extended
Data Fig. 9). Interestingly, genes that are linked in other bilaterians but not in octopus are
enriched in neighboring SINE content. SINE insertions around these genes date to the time
of tandem C2H2 expansion (Extended Data Fig. 9d), pointing to a crucial period of genome
evolution in octopus. Other transposons such as Mariner show no such enrichment,
suggesting distinct roles for different classes of transposons in shaping genome structure
(Extended Data Fig. 9c).

Author Manuscript

Transposable element activity has been implicated in the modification of gene regulation
across several eukaryotic lineages29. We found that in the nervous system, the degree to
which a gene’s expression is tissue-specific is positively correlated with the transposon load
around that gene (r-squared values ranging from 0.49 in optic lobe to 0.81 in subesophageal
brain; Extended Data Fig. 8; Supplementary Note 4). This correlation may reflect
modulation of gene expression by transposon-derived enhancers or a greater tolerance for
transposon insertion near genes with less complex patterns of tissue-specific gene
regulation.

Author Manuscript

Using a relaxed molecular clock, we estimate that the octopus and squid lineages diverged
~270 mya, emphasizing the deep evolutionary history of coleoid cephalopods8,30
(Supplementary Note 7.1; Extended Data Figure 10a). Our analyses found hundreds of
coleoid- and octopus-specific novel genes, many of which were expressed in tissues
containing novel structures, including the chromatophore-laden skin, the suckers, and the
nervous system (Extended Data Fig. 10, Supplementary Note 11). Taken together, these
novel genes, the expansion of C2H2-ZNFs, genome rearrangements, and extensive
transposable element activity yield a new landscape for both trans- and cis- regulatory
elements in the octopus genome, resulting in changes in an otherwise “typical”
lophotrochozoan gene complement that contributed to the evolution of cephalopod neural
complexity and morphological innovations.

Genome size and heterozygosity

Author Manuscript

The O. bimaculoides haploid genome size was estimated to be ~2.7 gigabases (Gb) based on
fluorescence (2.66–2.68 Gb) and k-mer (2.86 Gb) measurements (Supplementary Notes 1
and 2), making it several times larger than other sequenced molluscan and lophotrochozoan
genomes17. We observed nucleotide-level heterozygosity within the sequenced genome to
be 0.08%, which may reflect a small effective population size relative to broadcastspawning marine invertebrates.
Transcriptome sequencing

Author Manuscript

Twelve transcriptomes were sequenced from RNA isolated from ova, testes, viscera,
posterior salivary gland (PSG), suckers, skin, developmental stage 15 (St15)33, retina, optic
lobe (OL), supraesophageal brain (Supra), subesophageal brain (Sub), and axial nerve cord
(ANC) (Supplementary Note 2). RNA was isolated using Trizol (Invitrogen) and 100bp
paired-end reads (insert size 300bp) were generated on an Illumina HiSeq2000 sequencing
machine.
De novo transcriptome assembly

Author Manuscript

Adapters and low quality reads were removed before assembling transcriptomes using the
Trinity de novo assembly package [version r2013-02-2534,35]. Assembly statistics are
summarized in Table S2.2. Following assembly, peptide-coding regions were translated
using TransDecoder in the Trinity package. We compared the de novo assembled RNA-Seq
output to the genome to evaluate the completeness of the genome assembly. To minimize
the number of spuriously assembled transcripts, only transcripts with ORFs predicted by
TransDecoder were mapped onto the genome with BLASTN. Only 1,130 out of 48,259
transcripts with ORFs (2.34%) did not have a match in the genome with a minimum identity
of 95%.
Annotation of transposable elements
Transposable elements were identified with RepeatModeler36 and Repeatmasker37, as
outlined in Supplementary Note 4.2. The most abundant transposable element is a
previously identified octopus-specific SINE38 that accounts for 4% of the assembled
genome.
Annotation of protein coding genes

Author Manuscript

Protein-coding genes were annotated by combining transcriptome evidence with homologybased and de novo gene prediction methods (Supplementary Note 4). For homology
prediction we used predicted peptide sets of three previously sequenced molluscs (L.
gigantea, C. gigas, and A. californica) along with selected other metazoans. Alternative
splice isoforms were identified with PASA39. Annotation statistics are provided in Table
S4.1.1. Genes known in vertebrates to have many isoforms, such as ankyrin, TRAK1, and
LRCH1, also show alternative splicing in octopus but at a more limited level. Octopus genes
with ten or more alternative splice forms are provided in Table S4.1.2.

Calibration of sequence divergence with respect to time

Author Manuscript

The divergence between squid and octopus was estimated using r8s40 by fixing cephalopod
divergence from bivalves and gastropods to 540 mya8. Our estimate of 270 mya for the
squid-octopus divergence corresponds to mean neutral substitution rate of dS ~2 based on
the protein-directed CDS alignments between the species (Supplementary Figure S6.1.2)
and a dS estimation using the yn00 program41. Throughout the manuscript we convert from
sequence divergence to time by assuming that dS ~1 corresponds to 135 million years. For
example, unlinked octopus protocadherins appear to have expanded ~135 mya based on
mean pairwise dS~1, after octopuses diverged from squid. In contrast, clustered octopus
protocadherins are much more similar in sequence (mean pairwise dS ~0.4, or ~55 mya).
Quantifying gene expression

Author Manuscript

Transcriptome reads were mapped to the genome assembly with TopHat 2.0.1142. A range
of 76–90% of reads from the different samples mapped to the genome. Mapped reads were
sorted and indexed with SAMtools43. The read counts in each tissue were produced with
bedtools multicov program44 using the gene model coordinates. The counts were normalized
by the total transcriptome size of each tissue and by the length of the gene. Heatmaps
showing expression patterns were generated in R using the heatmap.2 function.
Gene complement

Author Manuscript

Gene families of particular interest, including developmental regulatory genes, neuralrelated genes, and gene families that appear to be expanded in O. bimaculoides, were
manually curated and analyzed. We searched the octopus genome and transcriptome
assemblies using BLASTP and TBLASTN with annotated sequences from human, mouse,
and D. melanogaster. Bulk analyses were also performed using Pfam45 and PANTHER46.
We also used BLASTP and TBLASTX to search for specific gene families in deposited
genome and transcriptome databases for L. gigantea, A. californica, C. gigas, C. teleta, T.
castaneum, D. melanogaster, C. elegans, N. vectensis, A. queenslandica S. kowalevskii, B.
floridae, C. intestinalis, D. rerio, M. musculus, and H. sapiens. Candidate genes were
verified with BLAST47 and Pfam45 analysis. Genes identified in the octopus genome were
confirmed and extended using the transcriptomes. Multiple gene models that matched the
same transcript were combined. The identified sequences from octopus and other bilaterians
were aligned with either MUSCLE48, CLUSTALO49, MacVector 12.6 (MacVector Inc,
North Carolina), or Jalview50. Phylogenetic trees were constructed with FastTree51 using the
Jones-Taylor-Thornton model of amino acid evolution, and members of each family were
counted.

Synteny
Microsynteny was computed based on metazoan node gene families (Supplementary Note
7). We used Nmax 10 (maximum of 10 intervening genes) and Nmin 3 (minimum of three
genes in a syntenic block) according to the pipeline described in Simakov et al. (2013)
(Supplementary Note 6). To simplify gene family assignments we limited our analyses to
4,033 gene families shared among human, amphioxus, Capitella, Helobdella, Octopus,
Lottia, Crassostrea, Drosophila, and Nematostella. We required ancestral bilaterian syntenic

blocks to have a minimum of one species present in both ingroups, or in one ingroup and
one outgroup. To examine the effect of fragmented genome assemblies, we simulated
shorter assemblies by artificially fragmenting genomes to contain on average 5 genes per
scaffold (Supplementary Note 6).

Author Manuscript

In comparison with other bilaterian genomes, we find that the octopus genome is
substantially rearranged. In looking at micro-syntenic linkages of genes with a maximum of
10 intervening genes, we found that octopus conserves only 34 out of 198 ancestral
bilaterian microsyntenic blocks; the limpet Lottia and amphioxus retain more than twice as
many such linkages (96 and 140, respectively). This difference remains significant after
accounting for genes missed through orthology assignment as well as simulations of shorter
scaffold sizes (Methods; Supplementary Note 6; Extended Data Fig. 9b). Scans for intragenomic synteny, and doubly conserved synteny with Lottia, were performed as described in
Supplemental Note 6.
Transposable elements and synteny dynamics
5kb up- and down-stream regions of genes were surveyed for transposable element (TE)
content. For genes with non-zero TE load, their assignment to either conserved or lost
bilaterian synteny in octopus was done using the micro-synteny calculation described above.
The number of genes for each category and TE class were as follows: 484 genes for retained
synteny and 1,193 genes in lost synteny for all TE classes; 440 and 1,107, respectively, for
SINEs; and 116 and 290, respectively, for Mariner. Wilcoxon-U-tests for the difference of
TE load in linked vs. non-linked genes were conducted in R.

Author Manuscript

To assess transposon activity we assigned transcriptome read aligned to 5,496,558 annotated
transposon loci using bedtools44. Of these, 2,685,265 loci showed expression in at least one
of the tissues.
RNA editing

Author Manuscript

RNA-Seq reads were mapped to the genome with TopHat52, and SAMtools43 was used to
identify SNPs between the genomic and the RNA sequences. To identify polymorphic
positions in the genome, SNPs and indels were predicted using GATK HaplotypeCaller
version 3.1-1 in discovery mode with a minimum Phred scaled probability score of 30,
based on an alignment of the 350 bp and 500 bp genomic fragment libraries using BWAMEM version 0.7.6a. Using bedtools44, we removed SNPs predicted in both the
transcriptome and the genome and discarded SNPs that had a Phred score below 40 or were
outside of predicted genes. SNPs were binned according to the type of nucleotide change
and the direction of transcription. Candidate edited genes were taken as those having SNPs
with A-to-G substitutions in the predicted mRNA transcripts.
Cephalopod-specific genes
Cephalopod novelties were obtained by BLASTP and TBLASTN searches against the whole
NR database53 and a custom database of several mollusc transcriptomes (Supplementary
Note 11.1). To ensure that we had as close to full-length sequence as possible, we extended
proteins predicted from octopus genomic sequence with our de novo assembled

transcriptomes, using the longest match to query NR, transcriptome, and EST sequences
from other animals. Gene sequences with transcriptome support but without a match to noncephalopod animals at an evalue cutoff of 1E-3 were considered for further analysis.
Octopus sequences with a match of 1E-5 or better to a sequence from another cephalopod
were used to construct gene families, which were characterized by their BLAST alignments,
HMM, PFAM-A/B, and UNIREF90 hits. The cephalopod-specific gene families are listed in
the source data file “cephalopodNovelties.xls”. Octopus-specific novelties were defined as
sequences with transcriptome support but without any matches to sequences from any other
animals (evalue <1e-3), including nautiloid and decapodiform cephalopods.

depicted. The D. melanogaster Hox complex is split into two clusters. We included genes in
the D. melanogaster locus that are homologues of Hox genes but have lost their homeotic
function, such as fushi tarazu (ftz), bicoid, zen and zen2 (the latter three are represented as
overlapping boxes). Hox genes in C. teleta are found on three scaffolds17. L. gigantea has a
single cluster with the full known lophotrochozoan gene complement. In O. bimaculoides
many of the scaffolds are several hundred kb long, and no two Hox genes are on the same
scaffold. The positions of O. bimaculoides genes approximate their locations on scaffolds.
Dashed lines indicate that the scaffold continues beyond what is shown. Scaffold length is
depicted to scale with size noted on the left. Genes are positioned to illustrate orthology,
which is also highlighted by color.

Extended Data Figure 4. Protocadherin genes within a genomic cluster are similar in sequence
and sites of expression

Author Manuscript

a, Expression profile of the 31 protocadherin genes located on Scaffold 30672 in 12 octopus
transcriptomes. Over three-quarters of the protocadherins are highly expressed throughout
central brain, OL, and ANC, while the others show more mixed distributions. b,
Phylogenetic tree highlighting Scaffold 30672 protocadherins in grey bars. c, Expression
profile of the 17 protocadherin genes located on Scaffold 9600. Almost all of these
protocadherins are most highly expressed in nervous tissues, with the exception of
Ocbimv220039316m, which is most highly expressed in the St15 sample. d, Phylogenetic
tree highlighting Scaffold 9600 protocadherins in grey bars. As seen in b, protocadherins of
the same scaffold tend to cluster together on the tree. Order of the genes in the heatmaps (a,
c) follows the ordering on the corresponding scaffold.

Extended Data Figure 5. Expansion of Interleukin (IL) 17-like genes

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

a, Phylogenetic tree of interleukin genes in Obi, Cte, Cgi, and Lgi. Mammalian IL1a, IL1b,
and IL7 used as outgroups. Human and mouse IL17s branch from other members of the IL
family. Octopus ILs (as well as all identified invertebrate ILs) group with the mammalian
IL17 branch and are named “IL17-like”. The 31 octopus genes are distributed across 5
scaffolds: Scaffold A (Obi_A), 23 members; Scaffold B (Obi_B), 4 members; Scaffold C
(Obi_C), 2 members; Scaffolds D (Obi_D) and E (Obi_E), 1 member each. b, Expression
profile of 31 octopus IL17-like genes. Heatmap rows are arranged by order on each scaffold.
Blank rows indicate genes not expressed in our transcriptomes. The 27 genes found in our
transcriptomes have strong expression in the suckers and skin. The Scaffold C genes are
enriched in the PSG and the Scaffold D gene is enriched in the viscera. c, Conserved
cysteine residues in human IL17 and invertebrate IL17-like proteins. The human IL17
proteins share a conserved cysteine motif comprising 4 cysteine residues, which may form
interchain disulfide bonds and facilitate dimerization56. Octopus IL17-like proteins also
contain this 4-cysteine motif, highlighted in yellow. One octopus sequence encodes only 3
of these highly conserved cysteine residues. These four cysteines are also present to varying
degrees in Lottia, Capitella, and Crassostrea sequences. Two additional conserved cysteine
residues were found in the octopus sequences and are highlighted in red. The first cysteine
residue is found in all invertebrate sequences examined, and none of the mammalian IL17
sequences.

Extended Data Figure 6. G protein-coupled receptors

GPCRs, also known as 7-transmembrane (7TM) or serpentine receptors, form a large
superfamily that activates intracellular second messenger systems upon ligand binding. This
figure considers a subset of the 329 GPCRs we identified in O. bimaculoides. The full
complement of GPCRs is presented in Supplementary Note 8.5. a and b, As reported for
other lophotrochozoan genomes, the octopus genome contains chemosensory-like GPCRs:
74 GPCRs are similar to the Aplysia chemosensory GPCRs57 and 11 GPCRs are similar to
vertebrate olfactory receptors. c, We identified 4 opsins in the octopus genome (from top to
bottom): rhodopsin, rhabdomeric opsin, peropsin, and retinochrome. d, The octopus Class F
GPCRs comprises 6 genes: 5 Frizzled genes and 1 Smoothened gene (*). e, Thirty octopus
genes show similarity to vertebrate adhesion GPCRs.

Author Manuscript

a, Phylogenetic tree of AchR subunit genes identified in Hsa, Mmu, Dme, Cte, Lgi, and Obi.
Black asterisk indicates a Dme sequence that groups with alpha 1-4-like subunits despite
lacking two defining cysteine residues. b, Expression profiles of octopus AchR subunits.
Genes ordered as in the tree (a), starting from the gray arrow and continuing
counterclockwise. Putative non-Ach binding subunits are highly expressed in the suckers.
One sequence was not detected in our transcriptome datasets. In a and b, red asterisks
indicate subunits with the substitution known to confer anionic permissivity58. c, Divergent
octopus subunits lack nearly all residues necessary for Ach binding. Alignment of sequence
flanking the cysteine loop (yellow) of the L. stagnalis Ach binding protein (Lst_AchBP), the
human and octopus alpha-7 receptor subunits (Has_AchR7, Obi_10697+), and the 23
divergent AchR subunits. Essential Ach-binding residues on the primary (pink) and
complementary (blue) side of the ligand-binding domain are indicated26, with conservative
substitutions in a lighter shade. Outside of the binding residues, residues shared between the
alpha 7 subunits are shaded in light grey, with bold letters for conservative substitutions.

(TE) expansions

Author Manuscript

a, Circos plot showing shared synteny across 6 genomes. Individual scaffolds are plotted
according to bp length; scaffolds with no synteny are merged together (lighter arcs). Despite
the large size of the octopus genome, only a small proportion of the scaffolds show synteny.
b, Synteny reduction in octopus quantified based on synteny inference using gene families
with at least one representative in human, amphioxus, Capitella, Helobdella, Octopus,
Lottia, Crassostrea, Drosophila, and Nematostella. Drosophila, Helobdella, and Octopus
show the highest synteny loss rates. Branch lengths, estimated with MrBayes55, reflect
extent of local genome rearrangement (Supplementary Note 6). c, Enrichment of overall and
specific TE classes (base pairs masked) around genes from ancient bilaterian synteny blocks,
including those absent in octopus (see key). Asterisks indicates Mann-Whitney U test with
p-value < 0.02. d, Transposable element insertion history (Jukes-Cantor distance adjusted,
see text) into the vicinity of genes from ‘lost’ synteny blocks. Notice that only one SINE
peak is present; a more recent peak (visible in “All genomic SINEs”) cannot be recovered
from those insertions.

a, Schematic of Octopus bimaculoides anatomy, highlighting the tissues sampled for
transcriptome analysis: viscera (heart, kidney, and hepatopancreas), yellow; gonads (ova or
testes), peach; retina, orange; optic lobe (OL), maroon; supraesophageal brain (Supra),
bright pink; subesophageal brain (Sub), light pink; posterior salivary gland (PSG), purple;
axial nerve cord (ANC), red; suckers, grey; skin, mottled brown; stage 15 (St15) embryo,
aquamarine. Skin sampled for transcriptome analysis included the eyespot, shown in light
blue. b, C2H2 and protocadherin domain-containing gene families are expanded in octopus.
Enriched Pfam domains were identified in lophotrochozoans (green) and molluscs (yellow),
including O. bimaculoides (light blue). For a domain to be labeled as expanded in a group, at
least 50% of its associated gene families need a corrected p-value of 0.01 against the
outgroup average. Some Pfams (e.g., Cadherin and Cadherin_2) may occur in the same
gene, however multiple domains in a given gene were counted only once. Abbreviations

a, Phylogenetic tree of cadherin genes in Hsa (red), Dme (orange), Nematostella vectensis
(Nve, mustard yellow), Amphimedon queenslandica (Aqu, yellow), Cte (green), Lgi (teal),
Obi (blue), and Saccoglossus kowalevskii (Sko, purple). I, Type I classical cadherins; II,
calsyntenins; III, octopus protocadherin expansion (168 genes); IV, human protocadherin
expansion (58 genes); V, dachsous; VI, fat-like; VII, fat; VIII, CELSR; IX, Type II classical
cadherins. Asterisk denotes a novel cadherin with over 80 extracellular cadherin domains
found in Obi and Cte. b, Scaffold 30672 and Scaffold 9600 contain the two largest clusters
of protocadherins, with 31 and 17, respectively. Clustered protocadherins vary greatly in
genomic span and are oriented in head-to-tail fashion along each scaffold. c, Expression
profiles of 161 protocadherins and 19 cadherins in 12 octopus tissues; 7 protocadherins were
not detected in the tissues sampled. Cells are colored according to number of standard
deviations from the mean expression level. Protocadherins have high expression in neural
tissues. Cadherins generally show a similar expression pattern, with the exception of a group
of sucker-specific cadherins.

Figure 3. C2H2-ZNF expansion in octopus

Author Manuscript

a, Genomic organization of the largest C2H2 cluster. Scaffold 19852 contains 58 C2H2
genes that are transcribed in different directions. b, Expression profile of C2H2 genes along
Scaffold 19852 in 12 octopus transcriptomes. Neural and developmental transcriptomes
show high levels of expression for a majority of these C2H2 genes. In a and b, arrow
denotes scaffold orientation. c, Distribution of fourfold synonymous site transversion
distance (4DTv) distances between C2H2 domain containing genes.
