<TAXON> are extremely diverse invertebrate animals.
Soft-bodied cephalopods such as <TAXON> show remarkable morphological departures from the basic molluscan body plan.
While <TAXON> genes are commonly retained in multiple copies following whole genome duplication.
Overall, neurotransmission gene family sizes in the <TAXON> were very similar to those seen in other species.
Using a relaxed molecular clock, we estimate that the <TAXON> and <TAXON> lineages diverged, emphasizing their deep evolutionary history.
The divergence between <TAXON> and <TAXON> was estimated by fixing cephalopod divergence from bivalves.
We find that the <TAXON> genome is substantially rearranged.
<TAXON> novelties were obtained by BLASTP and TBLASTN searches against the whole NR database.
<TAXON> were photographed at distances of over 3 km from each other.
But <TAXON>, who are known to be semi-territorial species that typically stay within 80 m of their den.
Independent images of camouflaged <TAXON> in a coral reef environment and <TAXON> on a rocky/algal substrate were analyzed.
Humans have shaped taxa such as the critically endangered <TAXON>.
<TAXON> provide a valuable opportunity to explore the potential of this approach.
A clear understanding of how <TAXON> have responded to prolonged exposure to humans can offer new insights.
